# Unsolved Problems
Unsolved issues are, apart from the stretch user stories, removing a warning related to the entered date's format, figuring out a 3rd party calendar app to use on the site for visual organization, and making the site navigation more fluid (including adding some loading text/pages).

# Planning & Process
I started with the backend on this project, setting up my resources and going over a couple iterations of which properties I thought were necessary. I deployed to heroku and moved to work on my front end. I had not used React much before, so most of the app was a learning process. I tried to keep it simple overall, but ended up going with some Modals and Accordions since they fit the way I wanted to display the app data.
